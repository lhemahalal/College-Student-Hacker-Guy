# College-Student-Hacker-Guy
Submission for Hackabull 2021

## Inspiration
Inspired by old school sidescroller fighting games like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, we wanted to put a hacker-inspired spin on an old classic. 

## What it does
College Student Hacker Guy (CSHG) moves with arrow keys and shoots with space! They defend their Hacker Den's hometown from pesky bugs. 

## How we built it
Unity and C# scripting. We also used various drawing programs (SAI, piskel) for all in-game art and assets. 

## Challenges we ran into
We originally tried to do melee combat, but ran into an issue with the punching animation being too slow to register hitting the enemy, resulting in the player almost always getting hurt instead. Because of this, we refactored the game to involve a ranged fighting style instead. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
All in-game art and assets are hand-drawn by us, excluding the logo, made here: http://glench.com/tmnt/. 

## What we learned
This was our first time implementing a parallax background, so that was a fun learning experience for us! 

## What's next for College Student Hacker Guy
The hacker guy continues to hack.
